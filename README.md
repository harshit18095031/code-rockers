Space technology can play important roles in the reduction of disasters.Natural disasters can be succesful reduced only when detailed knowledge is obtained about frequency character of hazardous events in area.Data such as maps aerial photography, satellite imagery,GPS data,rainfall data etc.Many of these data will have a different projection and coordinate system and need to be brought to a common mapbasis,in order to superimpose them.We have to access information gathering and organising technologies and geographic information systems.

Geographic information systems provides a data base from which the evidence left behind by disasters that have occured before can be interpreted and combine with other information to arrive at hazard maps,indicating which areas are potentially hazardous.The  zonation  of  hazard  must  be  the ba sis  for  any  disaster  management  project  and  should  supply planners and  decisionmakers with adequate and understandable  information.  Remote  sensing  data,  such  as satellite  images  and  aerial  photos  allow  us  to  map  the variabilities  of  terrain  properties,  su ch  as  vegetation,  water, and  geology,  both  in  space  and  time.The  satellites  can  detect  the  early stages  of  these  events  as  anomalies  in  a  time  series.  Images  are available  at  regular  short  time  intervals,  and  can  b e  used  for the  prediction  of  both  rapid  and  slow  disasters.The  volume  of  data  needed  for  disaster  management, particularly  in  the  context  of  integrated  development  planning, clearly  is  too  much  to  be handled  by  manual  methods  in  a timely  and  effective  way.  For  example,  the  post  disaster damage  reports  on  buildings  in  an  earthquake  stricken  city may  be  thousands.  Each  one  will  need  to  be  evaluated separately  in  order  to  decide  if  the  building  has  suffe red irreparable  damage  or  not.  After  that  all  reports  should  be combined  to  derive  at  a  reconstruction  zoning  within  a relatively  small  period  of  time.

Remote  sensing ,  temporaland  spectral  resolution. ing  data  should  generally  be  linked  or  calibrated with  other  types  of  data,  derived  from  mapping,  measurement networks  or  sampling  points,  to  derive  at  parameters,  which are  useful  in  the  study  of  disasters.  The  linkage  is  done  in  two ways,  either  via  visu al  interpretation  of  the  image  or  via classification.  The  data  required  for  disaster  management  is coming  from  different  scientific  disciplines,  and  should  be integrated.In  general  the  following  type s  of  data  are  required:
 Data  on  the  disastrous  phenomena  (e.g.  landslides, floods,  earthquakes),  their  location,  frequency,  magnitude etc. 
Data  on  the  environment  in  which  the  disastrous  events might  take  place:  topography,  geology,  geomorphology, soils, hydrology,  land  use,  vegetation  etc. 
 Data  on  the  disastrous  phenomena  (e.g.  landslides, floods,  earthquakes),  their  location,  frequency,  magnitude etc. 
Data  on  the  elements  that  might  be  destroyed  if  the  event takes  place:  infrastructure,  settlements,  population, socioeconomic  data  etc. 
Data  on  the  emergency  relief  resources,  such  as  hospitals, fire  brigades,  police  st ations,  water  houses  etc.


One  of  the  main  advantages  of  the  use  of  the  powerful combination  techniques  of  a  GIS  is  the  evaluation of  several hazard  and  risk  scenarios  that  can  be  used  in  the  decisionmaking  about  the  future  development  of  an  area,  and  the optimum  way  to  protect  it  from  natural  disasters.  Remote sensing  data  derived  from  satellites  are  excellent  tools  in  the mapping of  the  spatial  distribution  of  disaster  related  data within  a  relatively  short  period  of  time.

Hence the GIS(Geographic Informaton Systems) can be effectively use to preventnand predict natural disasters.
